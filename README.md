## 🚀 Overview

**HuntPad** is a mobile application designed specifically for **bug hunters and mobile pentesters**.  
It works as a technical notebook that helps organize **bug bounty programs**, **testing checklists**, and **security notes** — all in one place.

Unlike generic note-taking tools, HuntPad is built around the real workflow of mobile security testing.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Bug hunters often rely on tools like Notion, spreadsheets, or plain notes, which:

- Are not optimized for mobile usage  
- Depend heavily on internet connection  
- Lack structure for security testing workflows  
- Mix technical data with generic notes  

This leads to disorganization and loss of important context during pentests.

---

## 💡 Solution

HuntPad centralizes the entire bug bounty workflow into a **mobile-first**, **offline-first** experience:

- Program-based organization  
- Mobile security testing checklists  
- Structured technical notes  
- Fast local storage with performance in mind  

Everything designed for real-world usage during mobile app analysis.
